### Welcome!
This website is a selection of things I've made as a way to get to know me better.  If you want to see more of how the sausage is made, I suggest you head over to my Github @theporpoise.  Expect a bit of philosophy dropped in here and there to provide context.

### Status
I used to be interested in the things I could buy.  Now I'm interestd in the things I can make.  The transition from an american consumer to a responsible creator has taken a lot of interesting turns and been an amazing journey.  I love to make things and think about how they could be made better.  If you have a product, a vision, or a dream I'd love to be a contributor. 

### Current Interests
VR and distributed marketplaces.

### My love of Data On Pause
I have a lot of experience with statistics, analysis, game theory, and a touch of machine learning.  I really do love data, but I somehow got a bit bored and became focused more on the backend foundational systems, the platforms, for interaction.  Hence the interest shift to VR and distributed marketplaces.  

Advanced statistical analysis (A.K.A. machine learning) is a great meta tool for building better tools and interfaces.  But I feel like it's missing some of the creative art of human interaction that raw platforms can enable.  Essentially I view it as an optimization and not a creation under normal circumstances.  Yes, it makes money.  Yes, it's useful.  But right now I'm after something else.  

I intend to come back to data, stats, and machine learning when there's more stuff to optimize :-).  Maybe in a year or two.
