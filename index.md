### Welcome!
I used to be interested in the things I could buy.  Now I'm interestd in the things I can make.  The transition from an american consumer to a responsible creator has taken a lot of interesting turns and been an amazing journey.  I love to make things and think about how they could be made better.  If you have a product, a vision, or a dream I'd love to be a sounding board and contribute in any way possible.

### D.R.E.A.M. and My love of Data
I have a lot of experience with statistics, analysis, game theory, and a touch of machine learning.  I really do love data, but 
I somehow got a bit bored and became focused more on the backend foundational systems, the platforms, for interaction.
Hence the interest shift to VR and distributed marketplaces.  Advanced statistical analysis (A.K.A. machine learning) is a great meta tool
for building better tools and interfaces.  But I feel like it's missing some of the creative art of human interaction that raw
platforms can enable.  Essentially I view it as an optimization and not a creation under normal circumstances.  Yes, it makes money.
Yes, it's useful.  But right now I'm after something else.  I intend to come back when there's more stuff to optimize :-).  
Maybe in a year or two.
