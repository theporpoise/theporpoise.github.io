# D.R.E.A.M.

I'm not interested in the things I can buy.  I'm interestd in the things I can make.  The transition from an american consumer to a responsible creator has taken a lot of interesting turns and been an amazing journey.  I love to make things and think about how they could be made better.  If you have a product, a vision, or a dream I'd love to be a sounding board and contribute in any way possible.
